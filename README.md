## Project Abstract

In the digital age, understanding celebrity influence on today's generation is crucial. This project explores this phenomenon using the YouTube Data API and Reddit to collect and analyze data for meaningful insights. The objective is to collect real-time data and analyze and derive meaningful insights from the celebrity-based data, their online presence, and their impact on today‚Äôs generation. This entails scrutinizing the nature of discussions surrounding celebrities, discerning whether they predominantly manifest in a positive or negative light. By navigating the intricate interplay between celebrities and their admirers, we aim to shed light on the profound ways in which these figures shape beliefs, behaviors, and preferences within today's digital age.

## Project Abstract
In the digital era, the impact of celebrities on the younger generation is increasingly mediated through social media platforms. This study aims to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze the extent and nature of this influence. Utilizing the APIs of two major social media platforms, YouTube and Reddit, we systematically gather a substantial dataset, which is then meticulously stored in a MongoDB database for robust analysis. Our methodology encompasses a multi-faceted analytical approach, including an Influence Matrix, Trends Analysis, Content Analysis, and Sentiment Analysis, to provide a comprehensive understanding of celebrity impact.

For Installation of different packages:-

Use requirements.txt file(Mentioned in how-to-run steps.)

## Two data-source documentation

* `Reddit` - We are using `/cristianoronaldo`,`/messi`,`/SelenaGomez`,`/KylieJenner`,`/DwayneJohnson`,`/ArianaGrande`,`/KimKardashianPics`,`/Beyonce`,`/KhloeKardash`, `/KendallJenner` etc.
* [https://www.reddit.com/api/v1/access_token]( https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/  ) - <this Reddit endpoint URL provide data for post related to all 10 celebrities.>

* `YouTube` -
*"auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
        "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
        "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs", - <this YouTUbe end point url provides data for celebrities >

Note:-
For Youtube, we also filter/ handle exceptions that are due to videos that have "Disabled Comments". 

 (One thing we observed is that YouTube API has a fetch request limit, if we cross that it will throw an error that more API calls will be taking place)

 {Also, a process is already running such that API fetch request will fetch every 1 hour and get the result in the Reddit and YouTube collections as discussed above.)

To view the information of this process:- Go to VM and log in such that you are in user@CS515-25:- (user will be your username)
Run command: -  ps -ef | grep python3. 

You will be able to see more details in the MongoDB collections which display individual posts and comments.

 ## How to run the project?

Go inside project-1-implementation-team-caffeine folder:-
1)Using a virtual environment

python3 -m venv venv


2)Activate the virtual environment:

On Linux/macOS:
source venv/bin/activate

On Windows:
. venv/bin/activate

3)Installing all required packages 

python -m pip install --upgrade pip
Use this before installing the below requirements.txt  if  direct install doesn't work 

then,

pip install -r requirements.txt

3)run the main script 

python3 main.py

Please Note

1: Reddit API calls take some time to fetch as compared to youtube.

2: r/politics subreddit added as per our discussion with professor. This is loaded in a separate collection named "politics_data" and for checking the count, we are using a collection called "store_count".

For Installation of different packages:-

Use requirements.txt file(Mentioned in how-to-run steps.)

In this part of the project we perform various analysis based on the data that was collected. Along with this, we also made use of Modern Hate Speech API for toxicity detection. 

We performed four main types of analysis on celebrities and their overall impact:-
1) Comparative
2) Influence 
3) Sentiment
4) timeSeries/trends

 ## How to run the project?

Go inside project-1-implementation-team-caffeine folder:-

1) Using a virtual environment

python3 -m venv venv


2) Activate the virtual environment:

On Linux/macOS:
source venv/bin/activate

On Windows:
. venv/bin/activate

3) Installing all required packages 

python -m pip install --upgrade pip
Use this before installing the below requirements.txt  if  direct install doesn't work 

then,

pip install -r requirements.txt

3) Run the different script 

    1) Comparative
    
    python3 comparative.py
   
    python3 twoData.py
   
    python3 threeData.py
    
    2) Influence 
    
    python3 influence.py
    
    3) Sentiment
    
    python3 sentiment.py
    
    4) timeSeries/trends
    
    python3 trends.py

    For running plot that shows comparison between reddit and youtube in toxicity using --modern hate speech:-
    python3 mhs-plots.py
   
    --for generating politics comments binned hourly 
    python3 politics_comments.py

    **Note:
    We are collecting data for politics subreddit from 3rd of November to 17th November instead of 1st November to 14th November, we had a word with professor during the lecture regarding the same and he approved it.


    All plots will be stored under plots directory. We have run each kind of plot once and stored it just in case. 

    **NOTE: For  data that was to be collected between 1st and 14th. Due to vm problems there is no data on 5th and 6th and some inconsistencies that we had spoken to the professor in class. 

    Other than that we had run the project several times after the vm was restored for testing purposes and that's why you may see a spike on that date. Also, on 17th a spike is seen as after our first demo we were advised to do some changes in scheduling and we tested the same again. 


In this part of the project we have developed an interactive tool including various analysis based on the data that was collected. All the HMTL files should be under templates folder

The code structure :-

1-app.py- This file contains code which is based on the flask modules. By running this file, it activates routes to different analysis given below.
2-comparative.py- This file contains code which is based on the number of posts from Reddit and YouTube and here the comparison is made. 
3-influence.py- This file contains code which connects to MongoDB and generate plots based on the likes, comments for various celebrities for Reddit and YouTube.
4-sentiment.py- This file contains code which is using NLTK technique for NLP to find toxicity and influence of celebrities on people life's for generes such as music, entertainment and sports. 
5- static folder contains images, plots and styles used in our website. 
6- template contains html files for all the three analysis. 

We performed three main types of analysis on celebrities and their overall impact:-
1) Comparative
2) Influence 
3) Sentiment

 ## How to run the project?

Go inside project-3-implementation-team-caffeine folder:-

1) Using a virtual environment

python3 -m venv venv


2) Activate the virtual environment:

On Linux/macOS:
source venv/bin/activate

On Windows:
. venv/bin/activate

3) Installing all required packages 

python -m pip install --upgrade pip
Use this before installing the below req.txt  if  direct install doesn't work 

then,

pip install -r req.txt

3) Run the different script 

    1) For start of an interactive website or for waking up the server, use command

    python3 app.py

    This will open a website on host and port http://127.0.0.1:5000/

    Now for below analysis: 

    1) Comparative
    
    http://127.0.0.1:5000/comparativeAnalysis
    
    2) Influence 

    http://127.0.0.1:5000/influence


    3) Sentiment
    
    http://127.0.0.1:5000/sentiment_analysis


    For running all the plots that shows comparison between reddit and youtube :-

    4) General Plots

     http://127.0.0.1:5000/generatePlot
   

    **Note:
    
    In our MongoDB database, we have have collected data from 3rd November to 27th November for the toxicity and sentiment based data.All plots will be stored under static/plots directory. We have run each kind of plot once and stored it just in case. Also, the images that will be used in our website, are also stored under path static/images.
